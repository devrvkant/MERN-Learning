# MERN Learning 📚

Welcome to my **MERN Stack learning repository**!  
This project is a hands-on journey where I explored how **MERN applications** are structured, how different parts interact, and how to build full-stack features like authentication, real-time communication, and CRUD operations.

---

## 🔧 What I Learned

### 🔹 MERN Stack Fundamentals
- Setting up a full-stack app using:
  - **MongoDB** for the database
  - **Express.js** for the backend
  - **React.js** for the frontend
  - **Node.js** as the server runtime
- Connecting the frontend and backend using REST APIs

### 🔹 CRUD Operations
- Implemented Create, Read, Update, Delete features
- Used Express routes and MongoDB for backend logic
- Integrated React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to manage frontend state

### 🔹 JWT Authentication
- Built secure **user authentication** system using:
  - **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**
  - Password hashing with **bcrypt**
  - Protected routes and token validation

### 🔹 Basic Socket.io (Real-Time Communication)
- Introduced **Socket.io** in the backend
- Learned how WebSockets work
- Built a simple event-based interaction (e.g., real-time message or status updates)
